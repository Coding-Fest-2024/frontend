### Why we need need a new CUSP anyway?
The current course selection system, CUSP, is complex and unintuitive, often requiring information from various sources for course selection. This manual process is especially challenging for freshmen, gap year students, students attending exchange programs or combined degrees, or those who have failed courses.
### The Solution:
We're introducing a new course selection web app for the University of Sydney, designed to be efficient, dynamic, and user-friendly. Initially, it will support the Bachelor of Advanced Computing Degree units, using Vue.js 3.0 with Nuxt and JavaScript/TypeScript for processing, ensuring a maintainable foundation.
### Future about this project, what are we looking for:
Our roadmap includes expanding to include comprehensive course information and integrating a complete database, committing to continuous development and maintenance for in-depth educational planning.

# Functions v1:
Apr 10th Wed Version:
### Overlook at the page:
![[overview.png.png]]
### Top Navigation Area:
- Degree Selection: Users can select their desired degree from a dropdown menu, such as "Bachelor of Advanced Computing."
- Major Selection: Provides two slots for users to choose their majors, for example, "Computational Data Science" and "Software Development."
- Guidance Panel: After selecting the degree and major, clicking on the guidance panel to the right reveals a dark sidebar. This displays the chosen degree and the core course units pertinent to the selected major, aiding students in understanding the offerings across different degrees and majors.
### Course Selection Area:
- Year and Semester Layout: The system organises courses into "Year 1," "Year 2," etc., further subdivided into "Semester 1" and "Semester 2," visually arranging students' course plans for each term.
- Course Unit Area: Each semester features multiple boxes where different course units are placed. These units are colour-coded by category, with units sharing the same course prefix displayed in the same colour. Users can add courses by dragging and dropping units; duplicate courses cannot be added, and any course can be removed by clicking its top right corner. Clicking on a course unit reveals detailed information on the right side.
### Sidebar:
- This includes a search box, enabling users to swiftly locate specific course units by keyword, thus increasing efficiency.
- Below the search box, the sidebar serves as a reservoir of courses from which users can drag and drop to refine their selection.
